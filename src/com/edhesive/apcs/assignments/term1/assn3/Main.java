 * This program is a "Crack the Code!" game (of sort) which prompts

 * Phase 1: the number must be equal to 3
 * Phase 2: the number must be between 33 and 100 inclusive
 * Phase 3: the number must be positive and divisible by either 7 or 3
 *
 * If all 3 phases are successfully passed, the player has
 * successfully cracked the code
 * If any phase of the game is failed, the program ends
